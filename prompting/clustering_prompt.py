Given a list of raw scenario sentences, group them into high‐level test themes. Each resulting theme will be later used to generate one, and only one, JUnit {junit_version} test method.

{class_section}

=== RAW SCENARIOS ===
{scenarios_list}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Identify groups of raw sentences that test essentially the same logic in `{method_name}`.
   - For example, "sentence too short" and "hex substring at indices 6–8 fails to parse" both relate to parsing errors and should be folded together.
   - If two or more raw scenarios truly share the same testing concern, collapse them under a single theme.

2. For each group you identify, create exactly one object with:
   • "title": a concise CamelCase identifier
   • "description": exactly 2–3 sentences explaining:
       – which raw conditions this single JUnit {junit_version} test method will cover - be explicit!,
       – and what precise outcome it must assert.

3. If two raw scenarios do not share the same precise testing concern, keep them separate.  
   - Do NOT merge scenarios that test unrelated behaviors just because they share keywords (e.g. both mention "Parser" but cover different edge cases).

4. If collapsing two scenarios may lead to the generation of more than one test method later you should avoid clustering them and you should keep them separate.  

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Return exactly one JSON object with the key "scenarios", whose value is an array of objects. Each object must have exactly two fields—"title" (a CamelCase identifier) and "description" (2–3 sentences). The JSON must conform to this schema:
{ScenarioList.model_json_schema()}"""
