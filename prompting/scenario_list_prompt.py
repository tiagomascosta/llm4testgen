Provide a comprehensive list of behaviors and error paths that a unit test should cover for the Method Under Test (MUT) named {method_info['method_name']}, shown in the class below.

=== CLASS UNDER TEST ===
```java
{class_code}
```

(Note: Within this class, the MUT is the {method_type} method:

```java
{method_info['method_signature']}
```

All other code in the class exists only to show how `{method_info['method_name']}` is invoked and what helpers it relies on. Focus your scenarios exclusively on {method_info['method_name']}.)

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
- Each string is one sentence describing: "under this specific condition, we expect this precise outcome."
- Cover null or invalid inputs, parsing failures, boundary values, side‐effects (if any) and error paths.
- You MUST cover the core success path as well.
- Do NOT include test code, method names, or boilerplate — only human‐readable scenario descriptions.
- Be concise but specific: avoid vague phrases like "error return" without saying what error.

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Return exactly one JSON object with the key "scenarios", whose value is an array of one-sentence strings. The JSON must conform to this schema:
{RawScenarios.model_json_schema()}"""
